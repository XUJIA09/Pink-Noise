                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Pink noise is a very common noise in nature, mainly in the low and middle frequency bands, analogous to the properties of pink light. Because the human ear is more sensitive to high
                    frequency sounds, pink noise energy is distributed in the low and medium frequencies, making
                    the whole sound harmonious and "a very pleasant noise".</p>

                <p>The project collects common noises in my life and outputs a visualized pink noise image through
                    artistic computer processing. Users can customize the pink noise to create an exclusive image
                    based on the noise collected from their own surroundings. Hopefully, this will help to alleviate
                    the anxiety that some noises can cause. It is also hoped that this project will help create a more
                    accurate representation of the sound environment and in the future, as the project develops
                    further, help to become a useful tool for people to manage their sound environment and improve
                    their quality of life.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                <p>For a person who has a high tolerance for noise, as long as they have a place to lie down, they
                    can fall asleep. But there are still many people who, even though they can guarantee light and
                    time, are particularly sensitive to outside noises, such as cars outside their windows, the start of
                    the air conditioner or refrigerator in their own home, the footsteps of their neighbours, the
                    flushing of the toilet, the crying of their children, are all factors that make it difficult for them to
                    sleep.</p>
                    
                <p>For example, in the student flat I live in now: outside the window next to the DLR and the
                    train station, the sound of trains passing by drifts into the room very early in the morning; outside
                    the door in the corridor, you can often hear the neighbours' conversations or the loud sound of
                    the door closing; back inside the house, the bathroom's intelligent exhaust system, even for
                    something as trivial as washing hands, is overly sensitive and turns on automatically and lasts for
                    a long time; in the kitchen, the sound of appliances, dishwashers and In the kitchen, the sounds
                    of appliances, dishwashers, hoods and cooker hoods are interwoven. </p>
                    
                <p>Noise is one of those sounds that can be annoying and even dangerous to health. To add insult to
                    injury, the cost of getting to the root of the problem is very high, so I have tried to visualize these
                    noises in an interesting way and hope that by developing the project further I will be able to
                    control them.</p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>1. Control the angle of the squares forming the graphic with the amount of noise from the
                    window
                <img src="assets\images\p1.jpg"/></p>

                <p>2. The level of decibels of sound used in the kitchen controls the number of squares that make up
                    the figure (i.e. the density of the figure)
                <img src="assets/images/ki.jpg"/></p>

                <p>3. The number of layers that make up the graph is controlled by the decibel level of the sound in
                    the bathroom.
                <img src="assets/images/p3.jpg"/></p>

                <p>4. The decibel level of sound in the corridor controls the size of the area of the squares forming
                    the figure (i.e. the thickness of the figure)
                <img src="assets/images/p4.jpg"/></p>

                <p>5. Use p5.serialserver to connect to Arduino and p5.js
                <img src="../assets/images/p5.jpg"/></p>

                <p>6. Creation of sliders, visualisation of noise decibels
                <img src="../assets/images/p6.jpg"/></p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>So far with this project I have managed to collect the noise and stay with the visual graphics part. However, I still face some challenges in making it an effective tool to help people improve their
                    quality of life. One of the main reasons why pink noise can help with sleep is due to the masking effect of the
                    human ear and the phenomenon of human resonance. To move forward, I need to focus on
                    implementing the functions of input noise, processing noise, and outputting pink noise. This will
                    be the basis of my tool and will allow me to create a bespoke solution to manage the sound
                    environment, providing a tool that can help people manage their sound environment and improve
                    their overall well-being to improve people's quality of life.
